# FYP
Lightweight Deep Learning for Deepfake Detection

In this project, we attempt the Deepfake Detection problem at the video level.

This project's primary objective is to employ training and model reduction strategies to attain reasonably high Deepfake detection accuracy at reduced model cost.

# Data
We primarily used the FF++ dataset to pursue this project for a University final-year project. We do not own any of the data used, it is not included in this repo. However, the folder structure is left intact for you to refer to.
