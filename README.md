Lightweight Deep Learning for Deepfake Detection

We attempt the Deepfake Detection problem at the video level. Note: This project is purely intended for academic use.

This project aims to employ training and model reduction strategies to attain reasonably high Deepfake detection accuracy at reduced model cost.
